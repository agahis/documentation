# 2022 T2 Hand-Over Document

## Purpose of Document

The purpose of this document is to explain to future collaborators of this project what has been
accomplished. This document is a guide for future collaborators, on what their next course of action
ought to be.

## State of Project When Received

- The Task View and Submission Redesign project had just been conceived.
- No material had been produced on the project.
- Besides the goal of reducing PDF processing on the server and that we should explore using git on
  the back-end, there were little requirements at this point.

## State of Project at Hand-Over

- We identified several key stakeholders.
- We defined several features that were desired by the stakeholders identified.
- We created two competing designs that integrated all of the defined features.
  - Two iterations were performed on each design.
- We created a "back-end emulator" to test the viability of git as a back-end technology, and to
  assist with project on-boarding.
- We re-defined the features we previously conceived.
  - Close communication with a Thoth Tech managing director and the OnTrack area lead was
    maintained. They evaluated the feature list to ensure we didn't drift away from the core of the
    project.
- We altered the two competing designs (i.e, we performed a third iteration of the two designs) to
  conform with the changes in requirements (how the requirements were re-defined/re-interpreted).
