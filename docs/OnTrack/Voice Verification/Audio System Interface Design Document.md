**Figure 1** below shows the initial sketches and brainstorming put into place for the tutor’s interface when accessing the voice verification results.

\
\
**Figure 2** below shows a digital draft design for the flowchart between the three different results and visualisations I had sketched in figure 1 earlier. The visualisations are shown for the results and similar conventions that I would use for them to be displayed, while then branching off to the main processes that would subsequently become an output from clicking on these results.

\
**Figures 3 and 4** below shows the process and results when the tutor clicks on an audio file that has been unverified from the OnTrack Overseer system.

\
**Figures 5 and 6** below shows the process and results of when the tutor clicks on an audio file that is still pending and hasn’t finished the OnTrack Overseer process yet.

\
**Figures 7 and 8** shows the process and results of when the tutor clicks on an audio file that has completed the OnTrack Overseer process and has established the audio file as being verified.
